\section*{Methodology}

We will use a 6 Degree of Freedom (6-DOF) model for our system. In the Physical System section, we will describe simplifications we may make to the general 6-DOF model due to the physical nature of the system in Figure 1.

The controller design was based on the system's response to a step input. The controller allocation was designed as an interface between the controller and the physical system.

Once the controller was capable of stabilizing the system, it was optimized to minimize the 2\% settling time.
