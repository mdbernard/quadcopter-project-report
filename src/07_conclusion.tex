\section*{Conclusion}

We have derived the 6-DOF equations of motion for a quadcopter, the relation between the angular velocities of the quadcopter propellers and the forces and moments induced on the vehicle, and we have developed a controller to stabilize the system for a desired height and orientation.

We calculated the settling time score metric defined in equation (20) to be $\boxed{21.94}$ seconds.
