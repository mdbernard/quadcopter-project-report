\section*{Introduction}
In this report, we detail the design of a controller for the quadcopter system depicted in Figure 1. % TODO: include figure here

We begin with a description of assumptions and simplifications in the Methodology section. We describe features of the physical system and show an implementation of these features in Simulink in the Physical System section.

In the Control Allocation section, we describe the interface between the controller and the physical system. We includet this section before the Controller Design section in order to define the design goals of the controller. The controller design and optimization are described in the Controller Design section.

We conclude with the Optimization and Results section, in which we compare the results of our controller design to the goals defined in the project requirements.
